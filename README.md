### Update

#### 1.x->3.0
If you update from a Version < 2.0 please note that the plugin got completely rewritten. It is now based on Extbase. Therefore the complete api changed.
With Extbase you can include the webservice by dependency injection. Some of the APIs are changed as well.

#### 3.x->4.0
With the update there are a lot of Breaking changes. The Structures were renamed to use english names as well as use proper writing.

In Detail: 
```
Categorie -> Category
Stufe -> Section
```

With this the Repositorys are changed as well. The Section now knows about the Category Object and does not only store the CategoryID.

UserRepository->findByUid was renamed to findByUsername (since this is what it does)
